          Elenas: The Quest to Become Latam{"'"}s Social Commerce Leader
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-foreground/60 leading-relaxed">
          The Colombian company grew 70x over the past two years by giving
          low-income women a way to augment their income. By pioneering this
          social form of e-commerce in Latin America, Elenas could be the
          continent{"'"}s answer to Pinduoduo and Meesho.
        </p>
      </header>

      <div className="space-y-6 text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
        <p>
          It took Pinduoduo less than two years to become a unicorn. Despite
          entering China{"'"}s e-commerce market late, long after Alibaba and
          Tencent had built their empires, it took {'"'}PDD{'"'} just 21 months
          to reach a valuation of $1.5 billion. A little more than a year later,
          PDD went public, boasting 300 million active buyers and 1 million
          merchants. Today, the business is valued at $61 billion and is one of
          the sector{"'"}s dominant players.
        </p>

        <p>
          Success of this magnitude is not easily distilled, and yet, great
          businesses tend to have a revelation at their center. If Pinduoduo
          {"'"}s rise can be explained by a fundamental insight, it is this:
          shopping is social.
        </p>

        <p>
          Intuitively, we know this to be true. Societies ancient and modern
          have organized themselves around centers of commerce; bazaars, markets,
          and malls act not only as a loci of transaction but also of connection.
          E-commerce{"'"}s early movers mostly neglected this reality. When you
          navigate to Amazon or Flipkart or Alibaba, there is no sense of
          personal contact &ndash; only an endless, faceless aisle to be perused.
          Pinduoduo recognized this absence and reversed it. In doing so, the
          Chinese business became the face of a new kind of online buying: social
          commerce.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rather than abstracting human relationships, social commerce businesses
          lean into them. For Pinduoduo, that meant incentivizing customers to
          get their friends to join them in making a purchase &ndash; by turning
          a single order into a bulk one, customers unlock discounts. Meesho, an
          Indian business, takes a different approach. The platform provides
          infrastructure for individuals to sell existing products directly to
          their friends. In this construction, the seller uses extant social
          connections to build a book of business. It has worked extraordinarily
          well, with Meesho raising at a $8 billion valuation.
        </p>

        <p>
          While Pinduoduo and Meesho have fundamentally altered the complexion of
          their national markets and established dominant positions, many other
          promising geographies appear untapped. Indeed, the Global System for
          Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) estimated the total social
          commerce opportunity today to be worth $700 billion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Latin America seems particularly promising. The region boasts a massive
          addressable market, relative linguistic homogeneity, high GDP per
          capita, widespread internet usage, low e-commerce penetration, and
          long-standing cultural preferences for direct buying. In short, it
          looks designed for a Pinduoduo or Meesho-esque disruptor.
        </p>

        <p>
          After studying the business for several months, I believe that Elenas
          has the ability to become Latin America{"'"}s social commerce giant.
          Leveraging a playbook similar to Meesho{"'"}s, the company has reached
          annualized gross merchandise volume (GMV) in the tens of millions of
          dollars, growing more than 70x over the past two years. It has done so
          with limited venture funding and is now unit economic profitable.
          Mind-bogglingly, the company is run by a twenty-four-year-old CEO with
          close to a decade of experience. One tenured advisor referred to him as
          the most natural leader they{"'"}d ever met. If the best startups tend
          to be outliers, Elenas sits at the far edges of the bell curve by
          several different measures.
        </p>

        <p>
          Elenas{"'"} legacy may not be defined by any of these attributes. What
          makes the business most special is the impact it is having on the lives
          of low-to-middle income women on the continent. By aggregating access
          to products, software, and logistics they have allowed those with
          little money to become full-fledged entrepreneurs. So far, Elenas has
          served more than 100,000 of these {'"'}sellers,{'"'} enabling true
          economic empowerment.

          Origins: Zach Oschin{"'"}s Time Turner
        </h2>

        <p>
          Having gotten to know Zach Oschin for the better part of a year, I was
          shocked to learn during our interviews that he is just twenty-four
          years old. Elenas{"'"} CEO has the bearing, maturity, and experience of
          someone with a decade of experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          As it turns out, that{"'"}s the case. Despite his young age, Oschin has
          been running businesses since his early teens, holding down a startup
          job at the age most of us are worried about getting our braces off.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result is an entrepreneur that colleagues, mentors, and investors
          describe as preternaturally gifted, capable of managing through the
          highs and lows of company building like a seasoned founder.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Early entrepreneurship
        </h3>

        <p>
          Oschin comes from a long line of entrepreneurs with four generations
          preceding him building businesses of their own. That legacy meant that
          Oschin grew up in an unusually enterprising environment. Rather than
          getting an allowance, he was encouraged to start businesses to make his
          own spending money.
        </p>

        <p>
          At ten, Oschin started a local car washing business in his hometown of
          Los Angeles. While many of us might have been content to make a couple
          of bucks and call it a day, Oschin grew his enterprise over the next
          five years, taking over his neighborhood and employing a slew of his
          friends. At its height, {'"'}Westlake Washers{'"'} made a few thousand
          dollars in revenue &ndash; not bad for a founder barely into his teens.
          Oschin supplemented this income stream with another business, offering
          drone photography services for real estate brokers to build
          differentiated marketing materials.
        </p>

        <p>
          While Oschin learned a lot from these endeavors, he soon decided it was
          time to work for someone else. At fifteen, he reached out to a
          commercial space development business, XCOR Aerospace. What began as an
          unpaid internship focused on youth outreach quickly developed into a
          real, complex job. Over the next two years, Oschin would take
          responsibility for building out XCOR{"'"}s digital strategy, charged
          with managing social media communication and paid acquisition. He
          managed spending on Facebook and Google ads, worked with XCOR{"'"}s CFO
          on investor relations, and was flown out to launch events in Europe
          &ndash; all while studying for the SATs and completing his school work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oschin{"'"}s international experiences led him to Georgetown{"'"}s
          School of Foreign Service (SFS). Traditionally a feeding ground for
          diplomats, Oschin used the program as a launchpad for further
          entrepreneurial adventures. He traveled to South Africa to work for a
          logistics startup, Pargo, before spending the summer after his first
          year in Colombia at a venture studio called Polymath. It proved a
          fortuitous decision.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Joining Polymath
        </h3>

        <p>
          Founded in 2012, Polymath is one of Colombia{"'"}s best-known startup
          makers. The firm was founded by Wenyi Cai, a Harvard physicist turned
          entrepreneur. After selling her search business, Milo, to eBay in
          2010, Cai decided to help the next generation of entrepreneurs get
          their start. She moved to Bogot&aacute; and began incubating
          companies. To date, Polymath has created eight businesses and minted
          dozens of talented startup operators and founders.
        </p>

        <p>
          As it turned out, one of Zach Oschin{"'"}s mentors spent time at
          Polymath in 2016. After a positive experience, they encouraged Oschin
          to apply for a summer job thinking it would be a perfect fit for
          someone so passionate about emerging market entrepreneurship. The only
          problem was that Polymath didn{"'"}t have room for a summer intern. But
          Cai was convinced by the message she received from Oschin{"'"}s mentor.
          As she recalled it, the mentor said, {'"'}There{"'"}s this kid&hellip;I
          think he{"'"}s really going to be something.{'"'} She accepted an
          introduction and was quickly impressed by Oschin{"'"}s maturity and
          advanced business knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though neither Cai or Oschin could have known it, an enduring
          partnership was born. Over that summer, Oschin matured from an intern
          into a key player on Polymath{"'"}s team. Rather than return to
          Washington DC when summer ended, he decided to stay in Colombia to keep
          working.
        </p>

        <p>
          Somehow, Oschin managed to stay in Colombia and fulfill Georgetown
          {"'"}s educational requirements. How did he do that? How can you
          graduate from university and build a high-growth startup?
        </p>

        <p>
          The best answer is that Oschin owns a Time Turner, a magical instrument
          that allows the possessor to travel back in time. The second-best
          answer is that Oschin worked hard and managed to bend the system to his
          benefit. He {'"'}studied abroad{'"'} at a Colombian university, CESA,
          and compressed as many credits as he could into short sprints, returning
          to America on occasional red-eye flights. While his transcript might
          have given the impression he was a reasonably typical college student,
          Oschin was a full-time employee at Polymath and budding founder.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps Oschin{"'"}s greatest weakness was his scruffy Spanish. Though
          he had a few basics down, he would need to get a lot better if he was
          going to found a company in Colombia. He was thrown in the deep end,
          sent to conduct more than 150 user interviews in an unfamiliar tongue.
          In particular, he was tasked with talking with middle and working-class
          Colombian women to better understand their needs. {'"'}His Spanish got
          really good in a month,{'"'} Cai recalled.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Oschin remembered it, those early days involved {'"'}a huge amount
          of listening.{'"'} Across hours of discussions, he began to learn how
          different communities made money, their challenges, and how they hoped
          to improve their lives. Oschin and the team tested out new products and
          business models based on the lessons taken from user interviews. That
          investigation led them to the entrenched world of {'"'}direct sales.
          {'"'}
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Founding Elenas
        </h3>

        <p>
          If you were born in America or Western Europe sometime in the past
          three decades, there{"'"}s a good chance you might not have given
          direct sales much thought. The fundamental model involves a company
          allowing an informal workforce to independently sell the firm{"'"}s
          products. Arguably, direct sales had their heyday in the US as early as
          the 1950s with {'"'}Tupperware parties{'"'} an example of the approach:
          {'"'}dealers{'"'} sold products like Tupperware{"'"}s {'"'}Wonder Bowl
          {'"'} to their neighbors, earning money in the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          While versions of direct selling still exist in the US &ndash;
          Herbalife continues to use a direct sales model &ndash; it has largely
          died out. Not so, in Latin America. For reasons we{"'"}ll discuss in
          greater detail soon, direct selling remains popular in the region, even
          though it appears stuck in the past.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Oschin studied this market, he realized it was ripe for disruption.
          Despite barely innovating for decades, incumbent business remained
          large, and demand for the products sold through these channels still
          existed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Could this model be reinvented for the 21st century? How could
          technology enable thousands or even millions of women to run direct
          sales businesses more easily? What might that mean when it came to
          increasing household income? In summary, could social commerce work in
          Latin America?
        </p>

        <p>
          Oschin had found his idea and gave it a name: Elenas. It was inspired
          by the Greek word for {'"'}shining or guiding light{'"'} and hinted at
          the feminine and communal focus of the business. He quickly set about
          testing the questions he{"'"}d identified. He did so by returning to
          many of the women he had interviewed, offering them a chance to sell a
          small catalog of products to their friends and neighbors. His offering
          differed from traditional direct sales businesses in two critical ways:
          sellers didn{"'"}t have to keep any inventory, nor did they have to
          arrange delivery. To begin with, Oschin handled those tasks personally,
          taking Ubers across Bogot&aacute; to deliver orders.
        </p>

        <p>
          It didn{"'"}t take long for Oschin and his team to realize they had hit
          on a profound need. Even with no real product, women poured into the
          service, excited to have an alternative to decrepit incumbents. A few
          paid marketing tests demonstrated Elenas could sign new customers for
          as little as $0.05. {'"'}There was this huge pent-up demand in the
          market,{'"'} Oschin said.
        </p>

        <p>
          This traction was enough to convince Polymath that Oschin was on to
          something special. The incubator invested $500,000 to build an actual
          product. By the following year, Oschin had added a further $2 million
          in seed funding to finance Elenas.
        </p>

        <p>
          It had taken the then-twenty-one-year-old just six years to go from
          running a local car washing business to helming a venture-backed
          startup on a new continent.
        </p>

        {/* Latin America */}
        <h2 className="font-mono text-lg tracking-tight pt-6 text-foreground">
          Latin America: Built for Social Commerce
        </h2>

        <p>
          If you were to design an environment for social commerce, you{"'"}d be
          hard-pressed to engineer better dynamics than those that already exist
          in Latin America. While high-powered insurgents might have emerged in
          India and China first, LatAm seems like an even neater fit in many
          respects. That{"'"}s a consequence of the region{"'"}s demographics,
          consumer purchasing behavior, and competitive set.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Favorable demographics
        </h3>

        <p>
          To see how favorable Latin America is to social commerce, we should ask
          ourselves a series of questions: Is this a large market? Does the
          population have money to spend? Is there enough connectivity for a
          technological solution? How much retail spend is already online?
        </p>

        <p>
          According to The World Bank, India has a population of 1.38 billion
          people, a GDP of $2.66 trillion, and a GDP per capita of $1,927. China
          has a marginally larger population of 1.41 billion people, a higher GDP
          of $14.72 trillion, and a much greater GDP per capita at $10,434. Latin
          America and the Caribbean have a population of 652 million, combined
          GDP of $4.73 trillion, and a GDP per capita of $7,245.
        </p>

        <p>
          Effectively, Latin America boasts a massive regional population &ndash;
          47% of India{"'"}s &ndash; with a GDP that{"'"}s 1.77x higher. LatAm
          ends up looking a lot more like China than it does India on a per
          capita basis, meaning that there should be significantly more spending
          capacity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Roughly 68% of LatAm is connected to the internet compared to 71% in
          China and 41% in India. When looking at the number of mobile phones per
          100 people, China leads with 117, LatAm boasts 100, and India comes in
          at around 84. Social media usage is also high with 82% of LatAm{"'"}s
          population leveraging platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
        </p>

        <p>
          The retail sales that occur online are low at 4.9%, a figure that falls
          even further when studying rural, low-income groups on the continent.
          India sees 7% online sales while China leads the world by this metric
          at 46.3%.
        </p>

        <p>
          From a demographic perspective, LatAm was made for a play like Elenas:
          it{"'"}s a sizeable emerging market with a comparatively prosperous
          population, high connectivity, and low e-commerce penetration.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Unique buying behavior
        </h3>

        <p>
          It seems almost paradoxical that LatAm{"'"}s e-commerce penetration
          should be so low when internet adoption is relatively high. What
          explains the region{"'"}s disconnect here?
        </p>

        <p>
          One critical factor may be the {'"'}trust gap{'"'} between consumers
          and e-commerce players. Unlike other regions, Latin American buyers
          distrust tech players like Amazon or even local giant Mercado Libre.
        </p>

        <p>
          The trust gap is not restricted solely to e-commerce. Oschin pointed
          out that so much of the region being unbanked or underbanked is another
          example of this phenomenon.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ubiquity of offline buying channels has also slowed e-commerce
          adoption. Consumers are used to visiting their local tienda or favorite
          direct seller to make purchases. The persistence of the direct sales
          model is a particular quirk of Latin America.
        </p>

        <p>
          The significance of direct selling is reflected in its market size.
          Industry reports from the World Federation of Direct Selling
          Associations (WFDSA) indicate total revenue of $24 billion in the
          region. In 2020, WFDSA estimated 15.63 million direct sellers in the
          region, up from 13.39 million the year prior.
        </p>

        <p>
          Such figures compare favorably to other emerging markets that have
          supported social commerce plays. While Meesho has risen to a purported
          valuation of $8 billion in India, the country has a direct selling
          market of just $2.2 billion. As Rajul Garg, an investor in both Meesho
          and Elenas, remarked, {'"'}[Latin America] exhibits the behavior of
          re-selling even more than India.{'"'}
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Room to maneuver
        </h3>

        <p>
          Perhaps the final reason Latin America seems primed for a high-growth
          social commerce startup is that no business has established itself as a
          dominant player. The largest direct sales business in the world hails
          from Brazil. Founded in 1969, Natura has established itself as a leader
          in the beauty category, controlling brands like Aesop, The Body Shop,
          and Avon. The firm boasts a market cap of $6.8 billion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though these businesses have strong name recognition and large
          workforces in the tens of thousands, they have done little to innovate
          on the fundamentals of their offering. If incumbents enter the fight,
          they would need to build new core competencies in technology and
          disrupt much of their supply chain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Elenas finds itself in an envious position: addressing a massive market
          populated by sleepy incumbents and relatively early challengers.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Platform
        </h3>

        <p>
          The Elenas app serves as the hub for a seller{"'"}s business. Once up
          and running, a seller can quickly and easily create a company account.
          They browse the product range on Elenas{"'"} marketplace, adding those
          they like to a digital catalog. The products they choose become the
          contents of their store.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sellers can solicit sales across various platforms, including WhatsApp
          and Facebook, sending their catalog or individual items to friends and
          contacts. Using personal relationships, they can make tailored
          recommendations and suggestions, and adjust pricing with complete
          visibility into how their margins are impacted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Accepting payment is as simple as sending a link &ndash; the buyer can
          decide whether they want to pay online or in cash upon delivery. Over
          time, sellers return to Elenas many times over. It{"'"}s the place
          where they track their earnings, find new products, and build new
          catalogs. In many respects, it serves as a kind of Shopify-lite, built
          for emerging markets entrepreneurs selling within their communities.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Inventory
        </h3>

        <p>
          Elenas has taken an opinionated, differentiated approach to inventory.
          It doesn{"'"}t hold any inventory. Rather, it connects direct sellers
          with vetted product providers. Selection comes from almost five hundred
          different manufacturers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Elenas focuses on higher-ticket, non-perishable products &ndash; no
          groceries. Instead, sellers can choose from beauty, personal care, home
          goods, clothing and accessories. And while traditional direct sales
          businesses offer a limited range of products, Elenas offers 80,000
          products across ten categories.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Oschin said, {'"'}You don{"'"}t need me to tell you what kind of
          banana to get. It{"'"}s a banana.{'"'} By focusing on non-commoditized
          products, seller recommendations hold weight. And since delivery costs
          as a percentage of AOV are much lower, Elenas can serve a much larger
          area.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wenyi Cai noted that the company{"'"}s selection was an essential
          driver of seller retention. {'"'}Our most important differentiation isn
          {"'"}t that we{"'"}re digital,{'"'} she said. {'"'}It{"'"}s that we
          support many more categories and SKUs than traditional direct sales
          companies.{'"'}
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Logistics
        </h3>

        <p>
          Jeff Bezos once noted that {'"'}making your own power doesn{"'"}t make
          your beer taste better.{'"'} Elenas seems to believe in this maxim.
          Rather than vertically integrating a supply chain, the company prefers
          to outsource its logistical needs, focusing its resources on
          improvements that sellers and consumers can tangibly feel.
        </p>

        <p>
          Elenas has built extensive internal technology to optimize routes and
          provider selection, and gives clear, accurate data to both sellers and
          buyers. It also collaborates closely with the logistics businesses it
          works with.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-mono text-lg tracking-tight pt-6 text-foreground">
          Traction: Efficient Growth
        </h2>

        <p>
          Despite raising comparatively little money, Elenas seems to have found
          scalding product-market fit, evidenced by its extremely low customer
          acquisition costs, spiking GMV, favorable unit economics, and seller
          love.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Impressive acquisition
        </h3>

        <p>
          Traditional e-commerce businesses spend around $45 to acquire a
          customer through paid search advertisements. Pricing increases to $66
          when looking at display advertisements. Confidential sources have
          suggested that acquisition costs for Latin American e-commerce
          businesses can range between $26 and $80.
        </p>

        <p>
          Elenas acquires end customers for less than $1. It can do so because
          sellers are a highly effective acquisition channel, mass acquiring
          dozens of family members and friends. Thanks to the {'"'}pent-up demand
          {'"'} Oschin mentioned, Elenas can acquire sellers for about $10. The
          result is one of the most effective acquisition machines in digital
          commerce.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Strong GMV growth
        </h3>

        <p>
          In two years, Elenas has grown annualized gross merchandise value (GMV)
          over 70x. It{"'"}s done so while opening up a new national market in
          Mexico and weathering political unrest. A successful Mexico launch in
          May of 2021 and triple digit month-over-month growth has driven the new
          market to already represent a quarter of the company{"'"}s sales.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Jeff Weinstein, Partner at FJ Labs, said of the company, {'"'}The
          capital efficiency is there&hellip;The amount they{"'"}ve burned to get
          where they are is not crazy at all.{'"'}
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Positive unit economics
        </h3>

        <p>
          According to Weinstein, the company has relentlessly improved its cost
          structure, upgrading a negative gross margin to an expanding, positive
          one in just a year. Over the past nine months, Elenas brought down
          logistics costs by over 25%; the firm{"'"}s gross margins increased by
          400% over the same period. Moreover, Elenas grew its basket size by
          almost 40%.
        </p>

        <p>
          Combined with a low acquisition cost, Elenas sellers grow monthly sales
          by an average of 6x over their first year and top sellers have a more
          than 98% month-over-month retention rate.
        </p>

        <p>
          {'"'}Our success is directly aligned with the growth and development of
          our seller base,{'"'} Oschin said. {'"'}Investment in training and
          supporting each micro-entrepreneur as they launch their business
          creates massive impact while driving a healthy growth cycle.{'"'}
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-mono text-base tracking-tight pt-4 text-foreground">
          Seller impact
        </h3>

        <p>
          Perhaps most importantly, Elenas is working for the women it serves. It
          has rapidly grown its seller base to over 100,000, paying out millions
          of dollars in commissions. Top sellers earn hundreds of dollars a month,
          a sum that can make a real difference in low-income households.
        </p>

        <p>
          A prime example comes in the form of Andrea Maldonado. Before finding
          Elenas, the twenty-four year old mother of two was earning minimum wage
          as a cleaning lady. On just $200 per month, Maldonado struggled to pay
          for housing, food, or even the transport to make it to work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Elenas has transformed her financial circumstances. Using the
          smartphone she already owned, Maldonado began selling to friends and
          family members, proving to be a gifted salesperson. To date, Maldonado
          has sold $61,000 in Elenas products, earning $20,000 in personal
          earnings. It is now her primary source of income.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-mono text-lg tracking-tight pt-6 text-foreground">
          Moats
        </h2>

        <p>
          Already, Elenas has made savvy moves to create defensibility &ndash; a
          product moat through exclusive supplier relationships and 80,000 SKUs
          at prices competitors can{"'"}t match; an infrastructural moat via
          tightly integrated logistics and payments software spanning two
          countries; and a social moat where real-world bonds between sellers and
          buyers create retention that faceless e-commerce platforms can{"'"}t
          replicate.
        </p>

        {/* Team */}
        <h2 className="font-mono text-lg tracking-tight pt-6 text-foreground">
          Team and Culture
        </h2>

        <p>
          Every source I spoke with emphasized how special Elenas{"'"} CEO is.
          Michael Shoemaker, a co-founder of Linio and former GM of Uber in
          Latin America, said: {'"'}He is, of all the people I{"'"}ve ever met,
          the most natural leader/operator.{'"'} From a man in the orbit of
          Travis Kalanick and Oliver Samwer, this is a remarkable testament.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rajul Garg, founder of Leo Capital, noted a resemblance between Oschin
          and Meesho{"'"}s CEO, Vidit Aatrey. Both men are rational, product and
          metrics-driven builders. Oschin{"'"}s acceptance into the Endeavor
          network &ndash; which accepts just 1-2% of applicants &ndash; is a
          further indication of his leadership abilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every employee I spoke with seemed to have a sincere, intense
          connection to the company{"'"}s mission. Elenas is a business that goes
          to uncommon lengths to understand and listen to its customers &ndash;
          VP of Supply Chain Eliel Chang spends every Saturday visiting sellers to
          understand their needs better.
        </p>

        {/* Future */}
        <h2 className="font-mono text-lg tracking-tight pt-6 text-foreground">
          Future
        </h2>

        <p>
          Establishing itself as the OS for Latin America{"'"}s small business
          owners gives Elenas plenty of optionality. According to Oschin, 50% of
          sellers didn{"'"}t have a bank account before joining the service. In
          partnership with one of Colombia{"'"}s leading banks, the company plans
          on rolling out an internal wallet that gives sellers better control
          over their earnings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Elenas has the potential to become the de-facto financial solution for
          Latin America{"'"}s informal direct sales economy, providing loans,
          credit, insurance, and payment services. Expanding its fintech features
          not only opens up revenue opportunities but improves the health of its
          core business.
        </p>

        <p>
          It seems a matter of time before Latin America has a social commerce
          giant of its own. The opportunity is too large and the conditions are
          too favorable for a company not to capitalize. In Elenas, the region
          has a promising upstart. Not only does the startup elegantly map to
          existing buying behavior, it has shown an ability to grow without
          bloat, to win without waste. If Oschin and his team can maintain their
          impressive trajectory, Colombia may soon have a second unicorn.
